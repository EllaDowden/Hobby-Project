      <p>
        <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong> is a fantasy role-playing game
        first published in <em>1974</em> by designers Gary Gygax and David
        Arneson. Players role-play adventuring characters with different races
        and classes such as an elf wizard or dwarf fighter. One player, the
        Dungeon Master, facilitates the game, controls the monsters and
        non-player characters, and narrates the story. All players must work
        together to move the story forward, completing quests and slaying
        mosters.
